# Google Code Jam 2017 - Qualification Round

Phew, just completed my first real programming contest! Here is my solution to the first 3 problems of Google Code Jam 2017 Qualification Round - the Oversized Pancake Flipper, Tidy Numbers, and Bathroom Stalls. If you weren't in the competition but are interested in computer science, you can still view the full problems and test your solution against their test cases (especially the large data sets that almost use up the 64-bit integer space, which test the algorithm efficiency) at this URL: https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/3264486/dashboard#s=p0&a=2, it'll be worth it.
